## [Unreleased]

## [0.70] - 2020-04-07
### Added
- A changelog is now being kept.
- Around 10,000 new words have been added to the dictionary file.
- A "dist" folder which will contain the distributables from this point onwards.

### Changed
- Dictionary file is now in UTF-8 format.
- Configuration for MS Office installers has been changed from "Debug" to "Release".
- The distributables have been simplified for ordinary users.

### Removed
- Development on the aspell version has ceased. It's old, not enough people use it 
  and I don't know how to update it anyway. Last version of the aspell version is 
  0.60. It is not in the 0.70 distributables, however code is being kept in the repo.
